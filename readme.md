# A Toy Neural Network

This is a toy neural network that I wrote to learn about neural networks. It is written in Rust and uses a Matrix library that I created.
It is very rough (first Rust I have ever written); i.e., it should not be used for anything other that a passing curiosity!

Is it Blazingly Fast(TM). Nup. Is it memory efficient. Nup. Is it a good example of Rust. Nup. Is it a good example of a neural network. Nup.
